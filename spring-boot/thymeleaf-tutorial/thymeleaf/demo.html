    <h1>Welcome to my thymeleaf horizon.</h1>

Now if you run your spring boot application (If you don't make any changes, you application
will listen the 8080 port.) and then open localhost:8080/greeting there will be an white lavel 
error message shown. Why? Because, thymeleaf is serverside template engine. We have to resolve the view so that we can 
access the thymeleaf .html files from localhost.

Anyway, now create a controller class called GreetingController in our com.company package. And the annotate the class by @Controller annotate. This annotation will handle the view. No much modification will be required.

The GreetingController.java will look like.
