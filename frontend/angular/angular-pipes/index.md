# Angular Pipes

Angular provides built in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization(i18n) which is used for local information to format data.

We can use pipes to transforms strings, numbers, currency amounts, dates and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions to use template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application without writing additional logic transform your data. For example, you would use a pipe to show data as April 15, 1998 rather than the raw string format.

The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data formatting.
