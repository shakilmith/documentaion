  <h1>Polymorphism in Java</h1>
   <p>
    Polymorphism means many forms. When there is a hierarchy or relation between classes then it is called polymorphism in java. 
</p>

<p>
Polymorphism in java can be achieved through inheritance. I mean making parent child relationships. If you are aware about inheritance concept in java, then it will be very easy to understand polymorphism.
</p>

<p>
Look at the below example of class hierarchies: 
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
class Device {
  public void guessSize(){
    System.out.println("Device may have different sizes!");
  }
}

class Computer extends Device{
  public void guessSize(){
    System.out.println("The size of computer device usually big.");
  }
}

class Laptop extends Device{
  public void guessSize(){
    System.out.println("Laptop computer is smaller one.");
  }
}
class Mobile extends Device{
  public void guessSize(){
    System.out.println("You can carry a mobile phone in hand or pocket.");
  }
}

public class TestExample{ //must be file name
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    //create objects of device and subclasses 
    Device device = new Device();
    Device computer = new Computer();
    Device laptop = new Laptop();
    Device mobile = new Mobile();
    
    //execute the methods
    device.guessSize();
    computer.guessSize();
    laptop.guessSize();
    mobile.guessSize();
  }
}

/**
 * Output: 
 * 
 *Device may have different sizes!
 * The size of computer device usually
 * big
 * Laptop computer is smaller one.
 * You can carry a mobile phone in hand or
 *  pocket.
 */
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
You can see that how we reused the same method among three classes without defining method for each subclass. It's called method reusing.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Why polymorphism?
</b></br></br>
=> For code reusability. Define code once, and reuse it many times within related classes. By this mechanism, we can reuse attributes, methods among classes. But the precondition is inheritance.
