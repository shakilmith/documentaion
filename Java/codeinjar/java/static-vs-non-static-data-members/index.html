 <h1>Static and Non static data members in java</h1>
 
  <p>
  We know that Java class members are fields and methods. 
A field or data member can be static or no-static. If a class member like field is static then we don't need to create object of the class to access it. 
</p>

<p>See an example below</p>

<div>
<pre><code class="language-java highlight-block">
    public class Main {
 
//static data member 
static String name = "Mark Smith";
static int age = 30;

   public static void main(String[] args) {
    
//call the printSummation () method inside main method
System.out.println("Name is "+ name);
System.out.println("Age is "+ age);

   }

}
/**
*output:
* Name is Mark Smith
* Age is 30
* 
*/
  </code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You see, we don't need to create object of the class to access the name and age data members as they are static. 
</p>

<p>
But, if they are not static, then you probably have to use create method to access them, otherwise you will get error. 
</p>

<p>
See another example, where we have created an object to access the non-sratic data members.

</p>

<p>
  <pre><code class="language-java highlight-block">
   public class Main {
   
   //static data member
   String name = "Mark Smith";
   int age = 30;
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
   //creating an object of Main class
   Main obj = new Main();
   
   //print name and age using the obj of the class
   System.out.println("Name is "+ obj.name);
   System.out.println("Age is "+ obj.age);
   
   }
   
   }
   /**
   *output:
   * Name is Mark Smith
   * Age is 30
   *
   */ 
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
The same logic will also be applied other types of variables or methods of the class.
